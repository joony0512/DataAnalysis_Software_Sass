- like ‘H% ‘: 자릿수는 모르지만  H 로 시작하는 모든 문자
- like ‘__1’ : 1로 끝나는 3글자

### distinct : 중복행 제거, like

```sass
proc sql;
	select *
	from  A.internationalFlights;
quit;

//distinct
proc sql; 
	select distinct FlightNumber,
	Destination
	from A.InternationalFlights;
quit;

// >
proc sql;
	select EmpID, JobCode, Salary
		from A.Payrollmaster
		where Salary > 112000;
quit;

// name컬럼에서 like '아무거나, n으로 시작되는 단어'
proc sql;
	select Name, FFID
	from A.Frequentflyers
	where Name like '%, N%' ;
quit;

// jobcode칼럼에서 'f로 시작되는 글자'
proc sql;
	select EmpID, JobCode
	from A.Payrollmaster
	where Jobcode like 'F__' ;
quit;
```

- ESCAPE 절은 일반적으로 패턴을 검색을 위하여 지정하는 백분율(%)과 밑줄(_) 문자를 일반 문자
로 처리하여 검색하기 위하여 사용 : escape ‘/’라 하면 /를 빼버림 —> _를 일반문자로 검색가능

```sass
proc sql;
	select EmpID, JobCode
	from A.Payrollmaster2
	where jobcode like 'FA/_2' ESCAPE '/';
quit;

```

# calculated

- where  절이 select  보다 먼저 실행되므로, select 문에서 계산을 통해 새로만든 변수는 where절에서 조건을 걸때 변수 명 앞에 calculated 를 붙여준다.

```sass
proc sql;
select flightnumber, date, destination, boarded + transferred + nonrevenue as total
from a.marchflights
where calculated  total <100;
quit;
```

| FlightNumber | Date | Destination | total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 982 | 01MAR2000 | DFW | 70 |
| 416 | 01MAR2000 | WAS | 93 |
| 829 | 01MAR2000 | WAS | 96 |
| 416 | 02MAR2000 | WAS | 90 |

- 새로만든 변수에서 또 다른 변수 만들때는 select 구문에  calculated써준다

```sass
proc sql;
	select FlightNumber, Date, Destination, Boarded + Transferred + Nonrevenue
		as Total, calculated Total/2 as half
	from A.MarchFlights;
quit;
```

| FlightNumber | Date | Destination | Total | half |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 182 | 01MAR2000 | YYZ | 123 | 61.5 |
| 114 | 01MAR2000 | LAX | 196 | 98 |
| 202 | 01MAR2000 | ORD | 167 | 83.5 |
| 219 | 01MAR2000 | LHR | 222 | 111 |

- exercise : SUM

```sass
proc sql;
	select FlightNumber, Date, Destination, Boarded + Transferred + Nonrevenue
		as Total, PassengerCapacity
	from A.MarchFlights
	where calculated Total/PassengerCapacity < 1/3 ;
quit;

//논리 연산자가 null 값 처리 못해서 빈값 뜸

proc sql;
	select FlightNumber, Date, Destination,SUM( Boarded , Transferred ,Nonrevenue)
		as Total, PassengerCapacity
	from A.MarchFlights
	where  calculated Total/PassengerCapacity < 1/3 ;
quit;

//함수써야함
```

| FlightNumber | Date | Destination | Total | PassengerCapacity |
